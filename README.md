# Bedrust ü¶Äüß†‚õÖü™®

![screenshot of bedrust](/img/bedrust.png)

A neat way to invoke models on [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/). Written in Rust, and LIVE on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ruptwelve).

**NOW WITH CHAT üí¨** Yes, you can actually have a conversation with LLMs nowü•≥! Instead of it being able to just send one question at a time, you can now have contextual conversation with a LLM of your choice. This feature is available since version `0.6.0`.

Currently supporting the following models:
- Claude V2
- **Claude V3 Sonnet**
- **Claude V3 Haiku**
- Llama2 70B
- Cohere Command
- Jurrasic 2 Ultra
- Titan Text Express V1
- Mistral AI models (Mixtral and Mistral)

## Getting Started

To get started using this you need to do a few things:

### Get AWS credentials configured locally ‚òÅÔ∏è

To be able to interact with [Amazon Bedrock]() you need to have a set of AWS Credentials on the machine **Bedrust** will run on. The easiest way to get this set up, is by configuring the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). Make sure to install the AWS CLI, and run the `aws configure` [command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) to set your credentials.

To verify if you have your AWS credentials set correctly, you can run `aws sts get-caller-identity`:
```bash
darko@devbox [~/workspace/projects/bedrust]: aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "AIDAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX5",
    "Account": "123456789999999",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789999999:user/alan-ford"
}
```
Oh, yeah, make sure the user whose credentials you configure has permissions to `InvokeModel` on Amazon Bedrock.

### Make sure you have Rust installed ü¶Ä

Well that just makes sense, this is a **Rust** application. The easiest way to get started is by using [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Clone the Repository üíæ

As of this date, there is no way to *install* this tool to your machine in a traditional sense. Some elements are hardcoded paths (ie the `model_config.ron` file). And thus, the way you use **Bedrust** is by cloning this repository somewhere locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/darko-mesaros/bedrust && cd bedrust
```

### Running the application üöÄ

Finally, to run the application just use the following `cargo` command:
```bash
cargo run -- -m <MODELNAME> # replacing the model name with one of the supported ones
```

## Usage
```bash
Usage: bedrust [OPTIONS] --model-id <MODEL_ID>

Options:
  -m, --model-id <MODEL_ID>  [possible values: llama270b, cohere-command, claude-v2, claude-v21, claude-v3-sonnet, claude-v3-haiku, jurrasic2-ultra, titan-text-express-v1, mixtral8x7b-instruct, mistral7b-instruct]
  -c, --caption <CAPTION>
  -x
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version
```
Once, prompted enter your question, and hit `ENTER`. üöÄ To quit the program, just type `/q` in your question prompt.

## Captioning images

![screenshot of bedrust running the captioner](/img/captioner.png)

üöÄ **NEW feature:** Thanks to the multimodality of Claude V3, you can now pass images to this Large Language Model. This means we can do some fun things like caption images for the sake of accessibility. This feature is available in Bedrust from version `0.5.0`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently the only two models that support this are: Claude V3 Sonnet, and Claude V3 Haiku

To use captioning you just need to pass it the `-c` parameter, along with the directory where you have your images:

```bash
cargo run -- -m claude-v3-sonnet -c /tmp/test-images/
```
This will retrieve the supported images, and produce captions for them. Ultimately producing a `captions.json` file in the current working directory with the captions connected to image paths.

Here is an example of the output:
```json
[
  {
    "path": "/tmp/test-images/4slika.jpeg",
    "caption": "A computer CPU fan cooling a circuit board with Ethernet and other ports."
  },
  {
    "path": "/tmp/test-images/kompjuter.jpeg",
    "caption": "An open circuit board with various electronic components and wires, placed in an office or workshop setting with shelves and equipment visible in the background."
  },
  {
    "path": "/tmp/test-images/c64.jpeg",
    "caption": "Vintage Commodore computer monitor displaying the Twitch logo on the screen."
  }
]
```

Additionally you can customize captioning *prompt* and *supported image file formats* by editing the `bedrust_config.ron` file in the root of this project.

## TODO
- [x] Ability to get user input
- [x] Being able to select a model
- [x] Have a conversation with the model
- [x] Stream the responses back word by word
- [x] Better error handling
- [ ] Code Testing
- [ ] Ability to generate images
- [x] Make it prettier
