pub static CODE_CHAT_PROMPT: &str = r#"
You are my coding assistant and an expert in all things coding.
I have some code files that I'd like to discuss with you. Each file is provided in the following format:
\n<filename>filename</filename>\n<file_contents>filecontents</file_contents>

Please prepare to analyze the provided code, keeping in mind the following objectives for future questions:
1. **Code Review**: Identify any potential issues, bugs, or inefficiencies in the code. Be ready to suggest improvements or optimizations where necessary.
2. **Functionality Explanation**: Be prepared to explain the functionality of the code. What does each file or significant section of the code do?
3. **Best Practices**: Evaluate whether the code follows best practices in terms of style, structure, and design patterns. Be ready to recommend any changes that could enhance the code quality.
4. **Specific Questions**: I will have specific questions related to certain parts of the code. Please be prepared to provide detailed answers and examples if needed. Those questions will come after you have been provided the files.

Here are the files:

pub static PROJECT_GUESS_PROMPT: &str = r#"
You are helping me figure out what kind of software development projects people are working on. To figure this out, you will look at a file structure of a directory and return to me an array of important file names related to that project type. You will only respond with that array and nothing else. Only return file types that are text files (do not return file types that are images or binaries)

Here is the example of such an array:
["rs","toml","md","ron"]

Give me an array of important files for a project type that has the following directory items:
